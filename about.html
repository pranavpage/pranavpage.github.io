            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>
                I love solving real-world problems and building solutions from the ground up. 
                I often try to use new tools, new languages to solve problems even if I'll probably end up troubleshooting, 
                but the feeling of grappling with a different concept and coming up with a first sketch of a solution and seeing it work is what makes it all worth it. 
                I am passionate about algorithms, machine learning, graphics. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As a Modeling Systems Engineer at Qualcomm, I develop, implement and test receiver algorithms for fast and reliable detection of WiFi packets, 
                which are then implemented in 
                hardware description languages and synthesized into Qualcomm's WiFi chipsets for access points and mobile devices. 
                As part of the PHY Modeling team, my tasks involve 
                running rigorous test scenarios to catch errors, improving performance in terms of throughput and range, and maintaining the stability of the code base.
                C++, MATLAB, Python, shell scripting, Perforce and Jenkins are some of the tools that I use daily.
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated from IIT Bombay, Mumbai in June 2023 with a B.Tech and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering 
                and a minor degree in Computer Science. I have had a winding trajectory throughout college,
                beginning with an interest in instrumentation in astrophysics, going through computer networks, communications, 
                operating systems and machine learning. My Master's thesis was composed of two problems, 
                one on routing in satellite networks and the other on neural networks in dense networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey has been characterized by varied and enriching experiences, 
                from being invited to an Air Force base for identifying problems
                to defending a patent for a cost-effective fuel briquette manufacturing method. 
                I have had the privilege of 
                working on ASTROSAT data to detect gamma-ray bursts, and using weather and satellite data to 
                forecast sugarcane yields, helping me gain insights about problems in the agricultural sector. 
                A broad range of experiences in academia and
                industry have shaped my problem-solving and analytical skills, helping me develop adaptability 
                and an appreciation for sustainable, efficient solutions to complex challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not at work, I am usually found playing football, reading classics or 
                putting my computer through its paces with new Linux distros—so far, it's survived Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, and Arch Linux.
