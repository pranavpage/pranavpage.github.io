            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I love solving real-world problems and building solutions from the ground up. I'm drawn to new tools and
                languages,
                even if it means troubleshooting my way through unfamiliar terrain — because there’s nothing quite like
                sketching out an idea and watching it work for the first time. I'm especially passionate about
                algorithms,
                machine learning, and computer graphics.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm currently a Data Scientist at Carnot Technologies, where I work on decision-support tools for
                large-scale tractor
                fleets and OEMs. My work spans geospatial analytics, real-time dashboards, LLM-powered internal tooling,
                and integration
                with ERP systems. Prior to this, I was a Modeling Systems Engineer at Qualcomm, where I implemented and
                tested receiver
                algorithms for Wi-Fi chips used in mobile and networking devices — contributing to core PHY layer
                performance and debugging
                pipelines. I worked daily with C++, Python, MATLAB, Jenkins, and Perforce.
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated from IIT Bombay in June 2023 with a B.Tech and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering and a minor
                in Computer Science.
                My academic path has taken me through a winding mix of astrophysics, computer networks, machine
                learning, and communications.
                My Master's thesis combined deep learning and network optimization: one project on node estimation in
                dense IoT networks using
                neural networks and privileged feature distillation, and another on probabilistic congestion control in
                satellite networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, I've been invited to collaborate with the Indian Air Force on defense tech challenges,
                filed and defended a patent
                for a low-cost bio-waste fuel briquette, and built ML models to detect harvest patterns using SAR
                imagery for sugarcane farms.
                I've worked with ASTROSAT data to identify gamma-ray bursts and developed analytics products for both
                farmers and OEMs using
                telemetry and weather data — experiences that have made me comfortable working across disciplines, from
                space to soil.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of work, you'll find me playing football
